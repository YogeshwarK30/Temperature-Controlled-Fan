# Temperature-Controlled-Fan
It was a project done with the help of Arduino to control the speed of the fan based on the temperature. I also created a simple android application to control the speed of the fan manually if required.
The Aurdino varies the speed of the fan from analog reading recieved from the temperature sensor LM35.
